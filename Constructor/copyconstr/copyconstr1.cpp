/*
When should we write our own copy constructor?

C++ compiler provides default copy constructor (and assignment operator) with class. 
When we donâ€™t provide an implementation of copy constructor (and assignment operator) and 
try to initialize an object with the already initialized object of the same class then copy constructor
 gets called and copies members of class one by one in the target object.
