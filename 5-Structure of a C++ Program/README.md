What is a structure?

A structure is a user-defined data type in C/C++. A structure creates a data type that can be used to group items of possibly different types into a single type.

In C, there are cases where we need to store multiple attributes of an entity. It is not necessary that an entity has all the information of one type only. It can have different attributes of different data types. For example, an entity Student may have its name (string), roll number (int), marks (float). To store such type of information regarding an entity student, we have the following approaches:

Construct individual arrays for storing names, roll numbers, and marks.
Use a special data structure to store the collection of different data types.
